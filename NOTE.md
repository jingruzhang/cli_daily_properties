bundle gem daily_properties

command line interface for new properties sold in the neighborhood (& later maybe new houses listed in the neighborhood, too) zillow

with users typing in zip code, it shows a list of properties recently sold within the zipcode (a list of 20)

CLI interface: 
User type in: daily_properties
